          <p>I&#8217;m an interaction designer and front-end engineer with a decade of experience managing teams and projects.</p>
          <p>I focus on the intersection of clean design with clean code. I&#8217;m happiest when I&#8217;m collaborating with a strong team to simplify the complex, and to make people’s lives better.</p>
          <p>I&#8217;ve worked with Adaptive Path, Allstate, the Metropolitan Opera, Ning, and RealNetworks. In my spare time, I geek out on music.</p>

          <p>I create clear, functional interfaces. It’s important that I can write the front-end code for my designs so that I can embrace possibilities and avoid pitfalls. My design process is collaborative and relies on quick experiments to find solutions that help users, while meeting technical and business objectives.</p>

            2006–2009
          </h4>
          <p>I was a designer and client-side developer for Ning’s primary product, “Your Own Social Network,” for 3 years, beginning with its inception in 2006. By the time I left in 2009, the product had 36 million users and 1.6 million social networks. Our small design team, consisting of just myself and another designer from 2006–2008, created most of the interaction and graphic design.</p>
          <h5>The “Create Your Own Network” Flow</h5>
          <div class='thumb'>
            <img alt="Gyo" src="images/ning/gyo.jpg">
            <p>The interaction and graphic design of the “Create Your Own Social Network” pages was my first big project at Ning. Our goal was to make the process intuitive for non-technical users, while providing an understanding of the features and a feeling of ownership.</p>
            <p>I created wireframes and led usability studies to design a flow that was instrumental to the initial uptake and long-term success of the product.</p>
          </div>
          <h5>Sign Up Flows</h5>
          <div class='thumb'>
            <img alt="Signup" src="images/ning/signup.png">
            <p>Throughout 2007, Ning was focused on rapidly adding features to support a growing number of users. However, I argued that we could boost growth by redesigning our Sign Up, Sign In, and Invitation flows and pages. We released my redesign in the last weeks of 2007 and saw a dramatic surge that initiated the immense growth Ning saw in 2008.</p>
            <p>I updated the graphic design, flow, wording, and <abbr><span class="caps">HTML</span></abbr> &amp; <abbr><span class="caps">CSS</span></abbr> of the pages with an eye towards lowering every hurdle. I also set up and ran several rounds of usability studies that were critical to finding and solving issues.</p>

          <h5>Social Networking Features</h5>
          <div class='thumb'>
            <img alt="Photo" src="images/ning/photo.jpg">
            <p>In addition to the core product, I worked closely on most of the individual features of the networks, including photos, videos, messages, forums, groups, network administration pages, and an activity stream. I also worked on the initial product design that allowed for future features to be added in a modular fashion.</p>

            <p>I worked on the interaction and graphic design of LoudSauce, which enables crowd-funded advertising in <abbr>TV</abbr>, billboards and print media for non-profits and social good. I collaborated with 2 Rails developers to design and build a functioning site, starting from an existing static website prototype.</p>

            <img alt="Placebet" src="images/crowdcast/placebet.png">
            <p>I was the lead interaction and graphic designer for Crowdcast, which helps large businesses determine more accurate forecasts by aggregating employee knowledge through prediction markets. As the only designer, I led a redesign of the product to make it easier for users and administrators. Crowdcast was used by Electronic Arts, Hallmark, and several other major product and retail companies to gather and interpret information from their employees.</p>

          <p>I started my career as a front-end website developer after getting a Computer Science degree. I strive to write clean and maintainable code that uses modern practices while supporting popular older web browsers.

          <p>The design team at Ning was responsible for all <abbr><span class="caps">HTML</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="caps">CSS</span></abbr> code. Between 2006 and 2008, the team was just myself and another designer; by 2009, we had grown to 4 people. As a result, a large part of my job was writing and maintaining high-quality code.</p>
          <h5>Network Themes</h5>
          <div class='thumb'>
            <img alt="Themes" src="images/ning/themes.jpg">
            <p>Each network created on Ning has its own theme, consisting of colors, fonts and background images. I worked on the theme-creation page and creating an underlying product design that made sense regardless of the theme applied to it. I also created an <abbr><span class="caps">HTML</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="caps">CSS</span></abbr> framework to support theming across many features, including new and updated features. This was accomplished by separating layout and functionality from typography, colors and graphics, and creating a shared <abbr><span class="caps">HTML</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="caps">CSS</span></abbr> structure for common elements.</p>

            <p>I worked for Adaptive Path to build a prototype for an <abbr><span class="caps">AJAX</span></abbr>-enhanced web-based application for Allstate to provide insurance quotes. As the lead web developer, I built <abbr><span class="caps">HTML</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="caps">CSS</span></abbr>, JavaScript and graphics. I worked closely with two developers from Allstate, plus several interaction designers from Adaptive Path and Allstate. I wrote over 100K of object-oriented JavaScript to load <abbr><span class="caps">XML</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="caps">HTML</span></abbr> files, save and retrieve data entered by the user, and add animated transitions and effects.</p>

          <p>As a web developer at <span class="caps">POP</span>, an interactive agency in Seattle, I developed websites for the Metropolitan Opera, the Seattle Opera, and the Mars Rovers Science Team.</p>

            <p>In 2005, the Metropolitan Opera launched its first website update in 10 years, replacing a small static site with a dynamic site that included online ticketing and several hundred pages of information and history.</p>
            <p>As the lead front-end developer, I built an <abbr><span class="caps">HTML</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="caps">CSS</span></abbr> structure and led 2 junior front-end developers to build out the site. I wrote a script to generate the graphic headers from a text file, and made an <abbr><span class="caps">XSL</span></abbr> transformation that allowed us to manage the 4-level navigational structure of the site from a single file.</p>

          <p>As lead designer, I worked closely with all area and levels of the company, including the <abbr><span class="caps">CEO</span></abbr>, front- and back-end engineering, product management, and the support team. In addition, I led usability studies to incorporate outside user feedback into our product. From 2006–2009, I was the only constant member of the product team besides the <abbr><span class="caps">CEO</span></abbr>.</p>
          <p>I recruited and managed several excellent designers and front-end developers. To recruit them, I identified and reviewed resumes and portfolios, did dozens of phone screens, and selected the most promising candidates for on-site interviews with myself and senior team members.</p>
          <p>I also represented Ning at <abbr><span class="caps">SXSW</span></abbr> in 2008 on the panel discussion “Designing for Freedom” alongside Michael Lopp, Anil Dash, Brent Simmons and Braden Kowitz.</p>

          <p>As web development director, I led a team of five full-time web developers. In addition, I interviewed, hired and managed numerous web development contractors. I also initiated and wrote an update to the company’s coding standards for <abbr><span class="caps">HTML</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="caps">CSS</span></abbr> to transition to table-less <abbr><span class="caps">CSS</span></abbr>-based <abbr><span class="caps">XHTML</span></abbr> layout.</p>
          <p>As a technical director, I was responsible for the technical success of several clients, including InfoSpace, the Seattle Arts Coalition, Chow Foods Restaurants, and online ticketing systems for the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, Houston Symphony, and Houston Ballet. I worked closely with clients, designers, information architects, front- and back-end developers, and producers to meet deadlines and budgets with high-quality releases.</p>

          <p>As a program manager from 1999–2001, I managed development for the RealSlideshow product. I subsequently managed the My Channels program, supporting over 50 major companies that launched new or updated design for daily multimedia presentations built in <abbr><span class="caps">SMIL</span></abbr>, including <abbr><span class="caps">ABC</span></abbr> News, <abbr><span class="caps">CNN</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="caps">NPR</span></abbr>.</p>
